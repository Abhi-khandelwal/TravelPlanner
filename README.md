# TravelPlanner

This is a Web application that promises on partially solving the travelling salesman problem
in order to achieve functionalities in holiday planning with the SkyScanner API. We mostly pivoted around 
the problem of touching multiple location during our travels, so we optimalize the prizes as well as we can. 
The Website is modular enought to be easily extended int he future.

So far we acquired the ways to calculate an optimal route for you touching the control points added by the user, 
we are also capable of calculating by housing, so if the user would like to stay a little bit longer in a city 
during his/her travels, he/she could find the best prized option for it too.

We made a stylish looking website that is up-to-date to todays standards, with a basic Authentication system, 
by registering ot our homepage.

The website's frontend is written in some of the most used webdesign languages today, in a JavaScript, Html, Css combination, 
to assure the quality and reliability of the website.
For the backend we use Django, with Python(of course).
